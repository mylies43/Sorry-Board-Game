# Sorry-Board-Game
Massive C++(with some Java) project that simulates the board game of life with many data structures, including a ordered BST, several different types of linked list, and dynamic arrays. Head on over to the Java section first to create a gameboard and scenario for yourself,I recomend making the gameboard around 40 tiles with every single chance cards in the deck.In fact Ive already set it up like that in the c++ section if you dont want to make a file!If you do make a file in the Java section you will have to drag and drop it into the C++ folder.Have a good time playing the wonderful game of Sorry!
